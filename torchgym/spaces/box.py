class Box(Box):
    r"""A (possibly unbounded) box in :math:`\mathbb{R}^n`.

    Specifically, a Box represents the Cartesian product of n closed intervals.
    Each interval has the form of one of :math:`[a, b]`, :math:`(-\infty, b]`,
    :math:`[a, \infty)`, or :math:`(-\infty, \infty)`.

    There are two common use cases:

    * Identical bound for each dimension::

        >>> Box(low=-1.0, high=2.0, shape=(3, 4), dtype=np.float32)
        Box(-1.0, 2.0, (3, 4), float32)

    * Independent bound for each dimension::

        >>> Box(low=np.array([-1.0, -2.0]), high=np.array([2.0, 4.0]), dtype=np.float32)
        Box([-1. -2.], [2. 4.], (2,), float32)

        r"""Constructor of :class:`Box`.

        The argument ``low`` specifies the lower bound of each dimension and ``high`` specifies the upper bounds.
        I.e., the space that is constructed will be the product of the intervals :math:`[\text{low}[i], \text{high}[i]]`.

        If ``low`` (or ``high``) is a scalar, the lower bound (or upper bound, respectively) will be assumed to be
        this value across all dimensions.

        Args:
            low (SupportsFloat | np.ndarray): Lower bounds of the intervals. If integer, must be at least ``-2**63``.
            high (SupportsFloat | np.ndarray]): Upper bounds of the intervals. If integer, must be at most ``2**63 - 2``.
            shape (Optional[Sequence[int]]): The shape is inferred from the shape of `low` or `high` `np.ndarray`s with
                `low` and `high` scalars defaulting to a shape of (1,)
            dtype: The dtype of the elements of the space. If this is an integer type, the :class:`Box` is essentially a discrete space.
            seed: Optionally, you can use this argument to seed the RNG that is used to sample from the space.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If no shape information is provided (shape is None, low is None and high is None) then a
                value error is raised.
